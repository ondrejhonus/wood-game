## Planned Features ‚ú®  
#### **Will definetly happen:**
- **Wood Gathering**: Chop down trees, collect logs.
- **Basic map**: With interactable elements like trees and a sell point.
- **Player Model**: A simple humanoid character with animations.
- **Economy Management**: Sell wood to earn money, invest in better tools.
- **Tree generation**: Make the trees grow on random places on the map.
- **Vehicles for transport**: Purchase a vehicle to transport logs faster and more effectively.

#### **If it goes well:**
- **Process wood**: After gathering your wood, process it to make it gain value.
- **Local saving**: Save your progress to continue another day (locally).
- **NPCs**: Stationary NPCs throughout the map. 
- **Fishing + Cooking**: Fish for fishies to have food, cook them so they don't taste so bland.

#### **If it goes really well:**
- **Animations**: Animations corresponding to user action.
- **Car Modification**: Car mechanic for vehicle modification.
- **Clothing**: Make your character wear clothing of your choice. 
- **Building**: Use the wood to build yourself a house. 
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Cut down trees with your friends (Server based/Coop).
- **Cloud saving**: Save your progress to continue another day and never lose it.

## Game logic
- The player starts on a square with shops, where they buys the default axe and gets to know the place of his own plot.
- They then goes out to gather some trees, which they will sell at the wood sell point for some Shmeckles ($H).
- They can then use the money to buy better axes, a vehicle for transporting logs, or other items which will be implemented, etc. a wood processer.
- The vehicle will either be able to be upgraded (engine, wheel size, fuel tank size), or the player will simply buy a better one.
- They can refill their fuel for exchange for some $H at a specified gas station, that will appear at different set locations.
- There will be more types of forrests that will introduce more difficulty of getting into, and gear requirements such as better axes and more durable cars (Wood hardness, rivers for drowning small cars, hard terrain).
- The more far away and difficult the forest will be, the better quality wood it will contain (More expensive, heavier, thicker wood).
- There will also be a food system, they will either need to buy some food, or fish for fishies so they don't have to pay.
